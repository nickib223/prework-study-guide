# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a new developer in the beginning stages of bootcamp, the large amount of information learned can be daunting. This webpage was created to provide students with a single place to log everything they've learned and create a working study guide to reinforce learned concepts. The webpage is not only a useful study guide, it was a way to put newly learned knowledge to the test and employ the use of CLI, HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript to creat the webpage itself.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide is conveniently divided into topic headings for the main concepts learned in the Prework section for the bootcamp (HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript) and contains important information for each section to be studied. The webpage has a helpful reminder to check the DevTools console to review the JavaScript that is used for the webpage to reinforce these concepts and see JavaScript in action. The JavaScript will also randomly choose a topic for you to study first!
