          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Use h1-h6 in order to keep pages easily readable. h1 should only be used once.</li>
          <li>img requires a source (src=) and alt which provides an explanation of the image making it accessible for those using adaptive readers.</li>

          <li>Colors can be stated in semantic terms or by hexadecimal code using the format #number</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A period preceding a variable is a class selector meaning any element assigned to the class will gain the assignments of this selector</li>
          <li>CSS rules contain a selector {property: value; property: value; etc }</li>
          <li>A property: value pair is known as a declaration. Multiple pairs are known as a declaration block.</li>
